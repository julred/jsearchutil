# JSearchUtil

JSearchUtil can be used to easily find directories and files in a specific and pre-defined path. Of course you can use your search program from your local operating system, but in this case you can search much more faster.
E.g. Windows searches in a defined path with all subfolders. This might take some time. JSearchUtil only have a focus on the root path.
If you want to search for a folder which is inside of a specific path, you can find this folder much more faster with JSearchUtil!
